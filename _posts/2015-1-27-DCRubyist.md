Tonight was the Meetup with our local DC Rubyist group.  The meetup tonight was just about working on code.  Also getting a chance to bounce problems, ideas and just connecting with other programmers.  So far everyone the group has been a really welcoming and informative.  Connecting with a local programming Meetup group (or start your own) is one of the top suggestions in becoming a developer.  I 'highly' recommend that finding one in your area.
