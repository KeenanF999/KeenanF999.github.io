title: Windows Tip: Explorer to Cmd
---

I came across this while working on my system.  I always look for ways to speed up my work flow.  I've remember seeing it done in the past; but, I will admit to 'Googling it' to be sure it worked.  From Windows Explorer you can open the command prompt at your searched location in explorer.  How?

1. Navigate to your location in Explorer.
2. Press 'Alt + D' to highlight the location in the address bar.
3. Type in 'cmd' and press 'Enter'

The command prompt will open up at your navigated location.
