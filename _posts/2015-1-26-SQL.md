title: SQL!!!
---

Today in bootcamp (in my best radio announcer voice).  The lesson touched on SQL and how it relates to Ruby.  Nothing in depth; but, just the key points.  There were some nice common codes:

SELECT - extracts data from a database
UPDATE - updates data in a database
DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index

Have to keep these in my backpocket ;)
