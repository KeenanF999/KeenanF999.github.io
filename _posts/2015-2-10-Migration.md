title: Additional Migration Commands
---

In doing a quick search for Migration commands other than rollback.  I came across this list:

•	add_column
•	add_index
•	change_column
•	change_table
•	create_table
•	drop_table
•	remove_column
•	remove_index
•	rename_column

I was needing to make a correction to a database I created for project I'm working on.  Some of these transformation cannot be reversed.
