title: Finished First Course of Bootcamp
---

Wow, were to start.  Okay from the beginning.  I was of course nervous in selecting Treeleaf Academy after my (actual) first experience with online bootcamps (the first one wasn’t a good fit).  I got exactly what I was hoping for.  From someone who had little to none experience in Ruby and Web Development, it defiantly gave me a great foundation to build on.  I’m looking forward to the next course!
