title: GitHub 101 Tip
---

So you’re thinking about taking a Ruby developer course?  Well you gonna need to get to know some GitHub commands.  This shortcut is what you’ll use the ‘most’ in your interaction with Git.  It is committing changes to your Git repository.

1.	Open to your local repository from you command prompt and type in the following commands
2.	git status (this will show new/changed files in red)
3.	git add <file name> or .(to automatically all files)
4.	git status (your files should be green now)
5.	git commit –m “<add short message about change>” (it’s good practice to put something)
6.	git status
7.	git push origin master (it will ask you for your GitHub login/password)
8.	done

Knowing this will save you a ton of time.  But you will be sure to start memorizing it as you will be regularly updating your repositories.
